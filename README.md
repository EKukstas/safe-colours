# safe-colours
A module providing a set of colourblind-safe colours and colourmaps.
Colours come from Paul Tol's website: https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/
Module was initially written by Jon Davies: https://github.com/j-davies-astro

***

## Requirements
The module has been tested to work with:
```
python = 3.9.12
matplotlib = 3.5.1
numpy = 1.21.1
scipy = 1.7.1 (only needed for colourmaps)
```

## Functionality
The module has three methods:
- `safeColours.distinct_named()` provides a dictionary of up to 13 different colours, all with unique names.
The available colour names are:
`navy`, `cyan`, `turquoise`, `green`, `olive`, `sandstone`, `coral`, `maroon`, `magenta`, `brown`, `skyblue`, `pink`, `blue`

- `safeColour.distinct_list(n_colours)` provides a list of length `n_colours` where the choices of colours maximise the contrast.

- `safeColour.colourmap(maptype, invert=False)` provides a choice of three colour maps. The `maptype` choices are: `diverging`, `heat`, `rainbow`. Setting `invert=True` reverses the colour sequence.
